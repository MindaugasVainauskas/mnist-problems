## mnist image processing problems for emerging technologies
In this excercise I am pulling in MNIST image data from gzip library, process it and save selected image in the local storage

## Before running Python file:

 - Create data folder in your package directory;
  - create images folder in your package directory;
  - Download MNIST data set images/labels from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ in .gz format;
  - Place downloaded sets into data folder.
